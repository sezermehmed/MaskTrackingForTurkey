# MaskTrackingForTurkey
Program gives mask for people located in Turkey. It Checks ID information from official channel of government. Then it gives one mask for one time. (For COVID-19 Pandemic)

I did this project by watching following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EkMrrX9sYY   (Turkish Language)

Thanks to the instructor, this project made me understanding of OOP and a little bit SOLID, better. 


Program can check Turkish ID informations, and if they are true, output will be " {UserName} mask is given" if not "No mask.." 


This project is not finished.
