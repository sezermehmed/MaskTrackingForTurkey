# MaskTrackingForTurkey
Program gives mask for people located in Turkey. It Checks ID information from official channel of state. Then it gives one mask for one time.
I did this project by watching following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EkMrrX9sYY   (Turkish Language)

################

This project made me understanding of OOP and a little bit SOLID, better.


Program can check Turkish ID informations, and if they are true, output will be " {UserName) mask is given" if not "No mask.." 


This project is not finished.
