# MaskTrackingForTurkey
Program checks Turkish ID Number, if ID is valid in official, then it says "{UserName} mask is given" if not "No Mask". 

I did this project by watching following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EkMrrX9sYY   (Turkish Language)

Thanks to the instructor, this project made me understanding of OOP and a little bit SOLID, better. 



This project can be improved more.
